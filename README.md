# ‚òÅÔ∏è CAB432 Cloud Computing (Semester 2, 2025)

> _‚ÄúElasticity, scalability, and creative deployment in the cloud.‚Äù_  

This repository contains my notes and projects for **CAB432 ‚Äì Cloud Computing** at QUT.  
The unit focuses on scalable cloud architectures, public cloud deployments, and application design using services such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

## üìò Unit Overview

**Coordinator:** Matthew McKague  
**Languages/Tools:** JavaScript, Node.js, Docker, Public Cloud APIs

CAB432 explores cloud services from design to deployment, guiding students in building elastic, scalable, and secure applications. You'll develop containerised web apps, leverage cloud-based persistence, and implement architectures for global scale.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

- Understand the **elastic nature** of cloud services in business and technical contexts
- Select suitable **cloud infrastructure** and APIs from a range of XaaS offerings
- Analyse **performance, cost, scalability, and security** of cloud architectures
- Design and deploy **scalable cloud applications** using public cloud platforms
- Communicate clearly about cloud design decisions and implementations
